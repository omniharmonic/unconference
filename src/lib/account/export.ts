/**
 * "Download my data" (MT §12.6, spec §9).
 *
 * Everything this app holds *about the account*, as one JSON document the person can read
 * without a tool. Two deliberate absences, both stated in the export itself so nobody has to
 * guess:
 *
 *   · **Ballot entries are not here, and cannot be.** At close the round's key is destroyed
 *     and each entry becomes a token with no author (spec §5.3–§5.4). There is no query that
 *     returns "this person's votes"; building one would mean keeping the link that the whole
 *     voting design exists to destroy. The same holds for post-session feedback.
 *   · **Records in the person's own repo are not copied here.** They are already theirs and
 *     already portable: `com.atproto.sync.getRepo` hands back the whole repository as a CAR
 *     file. The export points at it rather than making a second, staler copy.
 *
 * Secrets never appear: no wrapped password, no token hash, no session id. Token *metadata*
 * does, because "what is connected to my account" is a question this is meant to answer.
