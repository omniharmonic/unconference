              This service runs on the AT Protocol, an open network. Some of what you do here becomes a{' '}
              <strong className="text-foreground">public record in your own repository</strong>, which anyone on the
              network can read and copy. Everything else stays on our server and is never published. This page lists
              which is which.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Your identity">
            <p>
              Signing up with an email address creates an AT Protocol identity for you on our own data server
              (pds.unconference.events): a permanent identifier (a DID) and a generated handle such as
              calmotter417.unconference.events. The handle is never derived from your email. Your DID and handle are
              public by design; that is how the network works.
            </p>
            <p>
              We hold the password for that identity on your behalf, encrypted, so you never have to manage one. You
              can take full ownership at any time from Account → Identity: we rotate the password, show it to you once, and stop
              holding it. You can export your whole repository whenever you like.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you sign in with an existing AT Protocol account (for example Bluesky), the public records you create
              here are written into that account&apos;s repository and are permanently associated with it. We ask you to
              confirm this before your first public action. Signing in this way also imports your public profile (display
              name, photo and bio) from the network into your profile here; you can edit those fields, and re-sync them
              from the network at any time from Account → Identity.
            </p>
            <p>Your email address is never published and is used only to sign you in and send the notifications you choose.</p>

          <Section title="What becomes public (records on the network)">
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
              <li>Session proposals you make, in your own repository: title, description, format, duration, topics and skills, and an optional public area you choose. Never an exact address.</li>
              <li>Your confirmation when you accept an invitation to co-host a session, in your own repository.</li>
              <li>Public endorsements, if you choose to make one. An endorsement is not a vote.</li>
              <li>An RSVP, only if you choose to share it publicly for a session.</li>
              <li>Your availability for a proposal, only if you choose to publish it.</li>
              <li>A public listing of your role at a gathering (for example host), only if the gathering allows it and you opt in.</li>
              <li>What gatherings publish in their own repository: the gathering itself, its policy, rooms, tracks, the published schedule, and vote tallies that show counts only, never who voted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Public records are copied by relays and other services across the network. You can delete a record you
              wrote, and we remove it from our index, but copies made by others before deletion may persist.

                to you; nobody sees live counts, including organizers. When the round closes, your votes are separated
                from your identity and the key that could link them is destroyed. Only the anonymous totals remain, and
                totals below a gathering&apos;s minimum voter count are not shown at all.

            <p>
              Private data is stored in a database on a server in Helsinki, Finland, operated for this instance. Public
              records live in repositories on our data server and on whatever servers the network copies them to.
              Transactional email is delivered through Resend.

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
              <li>Vote allocations are deleted when a round closes; only anonymous entries remain.</li>
              <li>Notifications are deleted after 90 days.</li>
              <li>Who invited whom is forgotten 30 days after an invitation is used.</li>

          <Section title="Optional Telegram assistants">
            <p>Organizers can connect a Telegram bot to mirror public announcements and answer event questions using their chosen AI provider. Questions and relevant event information are sent to that provider. Replies are also sent through Telegram.</p>
            <p>Linking your Telegram account is optional and does not publish that identity to AT Protocol. Transcript answers are sent privately, only to linked current members, using member-visible transcripts. The bot does not retain ordinary group conversations or chat history.</p>
            <p>Pending questions and answers are encrypted in our database, cleared after delivery or terminal failure, and purged within 24 hours. Telegram retains delivered messages under its own policies. You can disconnect in Account → Connections within a gathering, or send /unlink privately to the bot.</p>

              We set one essential cookie that keeps you signed in. There are no analytics, advertising or tracking
              cookies, and no third-party trackers.

              You can edit your profile, change notification preferences, hide yourself from directories, delete records
              you published, and take ownership of your identity from Account. To delete your account and the private
              data we hold about you, contact <Contact />. Deleting your account does not remove copies of public records
              held elsewhere on the network.
