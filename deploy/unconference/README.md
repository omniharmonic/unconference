# unconference.events — production runbook

One compose project on Hetzner `frontrange-twin-1` (`2.29.37.247`, CX33, Helsinki), beside the
Bioregional Twin. It shares nothing with the Twin except the machine: its own network, volumes,
Caddy and firewall (`unconference-fw`: 80/tcp, 443/tcp, 443/udp, attached alongside the Twin's
SSH-only firewall).

| Service | Image | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `caddy` | `caddy:2-alpine` | TLS and routing (`Caddyfile`); the only service publishing ports |
| `app` | `unconference-app` (this repo, `Dockerfile`) | Next.js AppView + web |
| `migrate` | same image | one-shot `db/migrations` runner, before `app` |
| `indexer` | same image | Jetstream consumer |
| `scheduler` | `curlimages/curl` | job loop: close rounds + drain publish/feed jobs (1 min), the gathering clock (`/api/jobs/lifecycle`: automatic phase changes, reminders, organizer alerts), notification dispatch and knowledge jobs (5 min), reconcile ATProto (hourly), retention (daily) |
| `postgres` | `postgres:16-alpine` | the AppView database |
| `pds` | `ghcr.io/bluesky-social/pds:0.4` | our PDS: custodial and gathering accounts |
| `backup` | `backup.Dockerfile` | nightly encrypted Postgres + PDS backup to R2 |

## Names

| Name | Served by |
|---|---|
| `unconference.events` | app |
| `www.unconference.events` | redirect to the apex |
| `pds.unconference.events` | PDS (whole) |
| `<handle>.unconference.events` | `/.well-known/atproto-did` and `/xrpc/*` → PDS; anything else → app |
| `<gathering-slug>.unconference.events` | the gathering's pages (app), and the gathering account's handle |

DNS (Namecheap): `A @`, `A www`, `A pds`, `A *` → `2.29.37.247`. Resend: DKIM TXT
`resend._domainkey`, SPF TXT `send`, MX `send` → `feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com` (needs
Namecheap Mail Settings = Custom MX), CNAME `rsend`.

**`PDS_HOSTNAME` and `PDS_HANDLE_DOMAIN` are written into every DID document the PDS mints.** Never
change them casually; moving hosts is a PLC operation per account (see Free School's
`docs/runbooks/pds-hostname-migration.md`).

## Secrets

`deploy/unconference/.env` on the server (mode 600), generated from `.env.example`. A copy lives in
`~/.config/unconference/production.env` on the operator's Mac. The age private key for backups lives
only there (`~/.config/unconference/backup-age.key`), never on the server. The PLC rotation key is the
one secret that cannot be regenerated.

### `APP_SECRETS_KEY` (required)

Seals the credentials organizers paste into the app — today a gathering's own answer-model key
(`event_ai_settings`, migration 0037): AES-256-GCM, a fresh nonce per key, the gathering's id as
associated data, so a sealed key is bound to the gathering it belongs to. Generate one and add it to
the env before the release that carries this wave:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32
# → APP_SECRETS_KEY=<paste>   in deploy/unconference/.env
```

Compose refuses to start the app without it (`${APP_SECRETS_KEY:?…}`, like `CRON_SECRET`). The app
fails closed rather than storing anything in the clear: with the variable missing or not 32
base64-encoded bytes, the server logs `[secrets] APP_SECRETS_KEY is not usable …` once, every write
of a key answers 503 `SecretsUnavailable`, and the Knowledge page tells organizers the operator has
not configured secret storage. Answers still work for gatherings covered by the deployment-wide
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

**Rotation destroys stored keys.** Nothing re-encrypts them: after a change every row in
`event_ai_settings` fails to open (logged once per gathering, answers fall back to the deployment
key) and organizers must paste their key again. If you must rotate, tell the organizers first, or
`delete from event_ai_settings;` so the UI shows "no key" rather than a key that cannot be read.

## First deploy

```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/frontrange-twin root@2.29.37.247
git clone -b main https://github.com/omniharmonic/schellingpoint.git /opt/unconference
cd /opt/unconference
install -m 600 /dev/null deploy/unconference/.env   # then paste the prepared env
deploy/unconference/release.sh
```

`release.sh` pulls, backs up (when a stack is running), builds, starts Postgres and the PDS, runs
migrations, starts everything, waits for `/api/health`, and runs the privacy audit.

Production tracks `origin/main`. The former `atproto` branch has been merged into `main`;
the web2 release is preserved at the `archive/web2-final` tag. Git pushes do not automatically
release this Docker stack.

## Everyday operations

```sh
cd /opt/unconference
C="docker compose --env-file deploy/unconference/.env -f deploy/unconference/compose.yml -p unconference"
$C ps
$C logs -f --tail=100 app indexer scheduler
$C exec app npm run -s atproto:audit            # privacy audit against production
$C run --rm --no-deps --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/backup.sh backup   # backup now
```

The previous application image is tagged `unconference-app:rollback-<commit>`. After checking
that it is compatible with the current database schema, restore that image without rebuilding:

```sh
RELEASE=rollback-<commit> $C up -d --no-build --no-deps app indexer
curl --fail https://unconference.events/api/health
$C exec -T app npm run -s atproto:audit
```

This rolls back application code, not database migrations. A schema rollback needs its own
restore plan. Keep the checkout on `main`; `release.sh` pulls a tracking branch and cannot be
used from a detached historical commit.

A run counts as good only when every artifact it should have produced exists at a plausible size,
locally and in the bucket (`pds-blocks.tar.gz.age` only once `/pds/blocks` exists). A missing one is
logged as `BACKUP INCOMPLETE: <artifact>` and the run fails; a good run stamps `/backups/last-ok`.
The `backup` service's healthcheck (`backup.sh --check`) goes unhealthy when that marker is more
than 30 hours old — i.e. when a nightly silently stopped producing restorable backups. Check it with
`$C ps` and `$C exec backup /usr/local/bin/backup.sh --check`.

## Restore rehearsal

```sh
# On the operator's Mac: fetch a night from R2, then decrypt with the off-box key
age -d -i ~/.config/unconference/backup-age.key postgres.sql.gz.age | gunzip > restore.sql
age -d -i ~/.config/unconference/backup-age.key pds-sqlite.tar.gz.age | tar -xz -C restore-pds/
age -d -i ~/.config/unconference/backup-age.key pds-blocks.tar.gz.age | tar -xz -C restore-pds/
# Postgres: create a scratch database and psql -f restore.sql; compare row counts.
# PDS: use a disposable, isolated PDS instance with outbound network disabled.
# Restore into its scratch volume, then check SQLite integrity and repository reads.
# Never replace the live production volume during a rehearsal.
```

## Payments activation

Paid checkout requires a configured Stripe platform and an eligible connected organizer
account. Without a key, paid checkout answers 503; free tickets remain available. Organizers
are the merchant of record and pay Stripe processing fees directly, with unconference taking
the selected contribution as an application fee. Automated tests do not establish live payment
readiness. Follow [`docs/STRIPE_ACTIVATION.md`](../../docs/STRIPE_ACTIVATION.md), verify the
current protected environment, and complete its sandbox checklist before enabling live sales.

Configure the server environment and recreate the app:

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — a **restricted** key, not a CLI session credential. It decides the
  deployment's mode: a `sk_live_`/`rk_live_` key makes this a live deployment and any webhook
  delivery whose `livemode` disagrees is refused. Permissions this implementation needs, write
  unless stated: Checkout Sessions, PaymentIntents (read), Charges (read), Refunds,
  Application fees (read), Connected accounts, Account links, Account login links, Webhook
  endpoints (read).
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — the signing secret of the destination below.
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_CONNECT` — optional, when the Connect destination signs with its own
  secret. Deliveries are checked against every configured secret.
- `STRIPE_ACCOUNTS_API=v1` — optional escape hatch that forces the v1 `controller` account
  path when Accounts v2 is not enabled for the platform. Leave unset to prefer v2.
- `STRIPE_ALLOW_PLATFORM_CHARGES=true` — optional, charges the platform account when a
  gathering has no merchant connected. Off by default and should stay off.

Keep sandbox and live keys, destinations and secrets strictly separate, and never put a secret
in chat, source control or browser JavaScript. Nothing logs a secret, signature or payload.

The webhook destination is `https://unconference.events/api/webhooks/stripe`, listening for:

- `checkout.session.completed`
- `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`
- `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`
- `checkout.session.expired`
- `charge.refunded`
- `account.updated` (Connect; keeps merchant capabilities current and pauses paid sales when a
  merchant loses one)

Deliveries arrive on the organizer's connected account. The app never grants admission from a
delivery's metadata: it resolves the session against its own `checkout_references` row and
requires that the reference's account matches both the delivered account and the gathering's
current one. Each delivery is also claimed by its Stripe event id (`stripe_events`) under a
lock held for the whole handler, so redeliveries — even simultaneous ones — do nothing, and
every refund carries a Stripe idempotency key.

A paid delivery the app refuses is recorded with its reason and listed on the revenue page
("payments that could not be matched to a checkout"): somebody was charged and got no ticket,
so it must not live only in a log. Where the payment is provably ours it is refunded
automatically in the merchant's context; the rest need checking in the Stripe dashboard.

Before live sales, run the sandbox walk-through in `docs/STRIPE_ACTIVATION.md`:
`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_… node scripts/stripe-sandbox-verify.mjs`. A $25 ticket at a 3%
contribution must produce a $0.75 application fee, no `transfer_data`, and a Stripe processing
fee deducted from the **organizer's** balance — with no fixed platform surcharge. Confirm the
signed webhook creates one entitlement and one notification, that retries and redeliveries do
not duplicate fulfillment, and that a full refund revokes participation even if the completion
is replayed. Compare the revenue page against Stripe: it reports the platform contribution as
the application fees actually collected, and the organizer's net as gross minus that
contribution, explicitly before Stripe processing fees.

Organizers refund from the gathering's Settings → Tickets page ("Paid sales"). Refunds are
issued in their own account's context; a full refund returns the contribution with it and
cancels the ticket, a partial refund does neither. Stripe processing fees are never returned.

The contribution is snapshotted when checkout opens; changing the event's rate affects new
checkouts. Disconnecting payouts stops paid sales while preserving ticket admission
restrictions. Free passes work without any Stripe configuration. Missing secrets, incomplete
onboarding or a paused merchant must never be presented as a successful live payment
verification.

## Feed, map and knowledge (optional services)

- **Feed**: no configuration. Organizers turn it on per gathering (Settings → Feed & network); posts
  go through the audited port as the gathering account. Off by default.
- **Map**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_STYLE_URL` (default OpenFreeMap `liberty`, key-less) and `GEOCODER_URL`
  (default Nominatim; the app sends `User-Agent: unconference.events (hello@unconference.events)`,
  paces to 1 request/s and caches 30 days). The map style is compiled in at build time, so changing
  it needs a release.
- **Knowledge — embeddings**: on by default and free. With `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER` unset the server
  embeds on its own CPU with Transformers.js (`Xenova/bge-small-en-v1.5`, 384 dims, q8 ONNX,
  ~33 MB), so the corpus is searchable with no API key and no transcript text leaving the box. The
  weights are baked into the image at `/models` by a build stage (`scripts/fetch-embedding-model.mjs`)
  and the runtime image sets `EMBEDDINGS_CACHE_DIR=/models` and `EMBEDDINGS_OFFLINE=1`, so the
  running server never reaches the Hugging Face hub — a release carries its own weights and a
  rollback keeps working. The Knowledge page reads `Embeddings: local (bge-small-en-v1.5)`; a model
  that fails to load shows there as an error instead of breaking the page.
  - `EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` picks a different Transformers.js model (rebuild so the image prefetches it).
    Chunks record their model as `local:<model>`, so changing it retires the old vectors and the
    embed job re-embeds; press **Embed now** on the Knowledge page or wait for the five-minute
    scheduler tick.
  - `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=none` switches embeddings off entirely (export still works).
    `voyage`/`openai` stay opt-in and need `EMBEDDINGS_MODEL` + `EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY`; those do send
    transcript text off the box, which the Participation settings disclose.
- **Knowledge — answers**: resolved per gathering (design 2026-09-25 §2.1) — the gathering's own key
  first, then this deployment's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (+ `AI_CHAT_MODEL`, default `claude-sonnet-5`),
  then none. Owners and admins set their own under **Knowledge → Answers**: Anthropic (model chosen
  from a list) or any OpenAI-compatible server at an https `base_url` (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Together,
  self-hosted), with a "Test connection" button that sends one token and reports what the provider
  said. The key is sealed under `APP_SECRETS_KEY`, returned to nobody, and shown only as its last
  four characters. With no key at all the Knowledge page reads `Answers: not configured`, those
  buttons stay disabled and the members' Ask page explains what is missing; search and the export are
  unaffected. Embeddings are never per gathering — they stay the operator's setting and run on the box.

## Remote MCP server (members' own AI assistants)

`https://unconference.events/api/mcp` is a read-only MCP server (Streamable HTTP, stateless) that a
member connects their own assistant to — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor. No configuration and no key: it
is on wherever the app is. A member mints a personal token in Account → Identity ("Connect an AI
assistant"); the token is `unc_<32 bytes base64url>`, shown once, stored only as its sha256
(`assistant_tokens`, migration 0028, server-only), at most five live per person, revoked
immediately from the same place. Requests authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer unc_…`; anything
else gets a 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`. The route answers
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` so browser-based clients (claude.ai custom connectors) can reach
it — safe because the credential is a header token and never an ambient cookie, and because every
tool is read-only. `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` serves RFC 9728 metadata with an empty
`authorization_servers` list, so a client that probes for an OAuth dance gets clean JSON pointing at
`/help/assistants` instead of the app's HTML 404. Budget: 120 requests a minute per token, counted
in the app process (one container, so that is the whole limit; more than one replica would multiply
it). Tools resolve the token to an account and then go through the same membership, session
visibility and transcript-tier checks the browser does — `search_knowledge` uses whatever embeddings
adapter is configured above and says so plainly when there is none, `export_corpus` is organizers
only and each page is logged to `knowledge_exports` like a zip download. Members-facing
instructions live at `/help/assistants`.

## Health and verification

- `https://unconference.events/api/health` → `{"status":"ok","checks":{"db":"ok","pds":"ok"}}`
- `https://unconference.events/oauth/client-metadata.json` → confidential client (`private_key_jwt`)
- `https://pds.unconference.events/xrpc/_health` → PDS version
- `https://<handle>.unconference.events/.well-known/atproto-did` → that account's DID
- Relay: `https://bsky.network/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getRepoStatus?did=<did>` once the PDS has requested a crawl

## Device notifications

Set `WEB_PUSH_PUBLIC_KEY` and `WEB_PUSH_PRIVATE_KEY` to a single generated VAPID key pair in the protected deployment environment. Keep the pair stable across releases: rotating it requires people to subscribe again. `WEB_PUSH_SUBJECT` defaults to `https://unconference.events`. The existing five-minute notification dispatcher also processes push deliveries.

People opt in from gathering Settings → Notifications, then choose push categories. Permission is requested only after they press Enable. iPhone/iPad require the app to be installed on the Home Screen (iOS/iPadOS 16.4+). Delivery uses generic lock-screen text; gathering details are read after opening the app. Device registrations are bound to the current login session and removed on sign-out or expiry. Failed devices retry up to three times; expired provider endpoints are removed. Verify actual receipt on an opted-in device before claiming end-to-end push delivery.

## Telegram bridge

See [Telegram setup and privacy](../../docs/TELEGRAM.md). Migration `0043_telegram.sql` adds the private bot configuration, participant links, budgets and durable outbox. The scheduler calls `/api/jobs/telegram` every loop. No deployment-wide Telegram token is needed: organizers connect dedicated bots in Settings → Telegram, encrypted with the existing stable `APP_SECRETS_KEY`. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` must resolve to the production HTTPS origin for webhook registration. Never enable the development-only `TELEGRAM_TEST_API_ORIGIN` in production (production ignores it).

After deployment, verify health, the migration and an authenticated scheduler response. This checks infrastructure, not real Telegram delivery. A real bot token and organizer-confirmed destination are required for a live message test. No bot is configured or enabled automatically during release.
